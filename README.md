This is a project to create an opensource human-centric-design methodology and approach to drive ideation with an organisation. Ideation is a great exercise sitting firnly between business-concept and MVP development. As an example, a bank has a concept for building a new mobile-application to support acquisition of youth banking. They can step straight into developing an MVP based around other competitive banking applications OR, they can enter ideation and try to generate brand new ideas that are differentiating and innovative setting themselves apart from their competition. 

This project presents 2 core concepts:

1. Customer Experience Journey Mapping
2. An Ideation Methodology

These concepts will enable anyone to work with a customer, map-out a customer (user or potentially process) experience journey and identify moments that matter where improvements can be made. These improvements may be achieved through people, process or technology changes - where process/technology changes are identified, the second concept will kick-in to help drive out ideation generating brand new ideas and business models. The second concept does not go as far as identifying specific technolgy solutions but it does go as far as identifying common capabilities required against stories generated through an HCD workshop.
